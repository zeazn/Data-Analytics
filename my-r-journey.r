    "# My R journey - The New Beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Just recently, I started to learn R and just now have started a Kaggle notebook to document my journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been an interesting few weeks and my brain still refuses to realise that this is not something I can learn overnight, or even in a couple of weeks. It will take time, and I need to allow time to practise (and not let my ADHD get the better of me).\n",
    "\n",
    "I never learned how to code, and short of building my Voron printer config file I have not had much exposure to anything like this. Sure, the 3D printer config file was not *reeeeeeeealy* coding, but there was formatting, there was commands and there was commenting, so I will take it as a win in my book!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we go. Good Luck to me, and hopefully someone finds this useful to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Down the rabbit hole we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I realised with Kaggle, is that this defaults to python. And this should be the **first** thing you change before to write anything. Itis just good habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy enough to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Click File above\n",
    "* Mouse over Language\n",
    "* Select R\n",
    "\n",
    "Done. Easy right? Well that is just the start."
